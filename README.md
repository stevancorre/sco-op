# Sco-Op

Why Sco-Op ? Because I loved playing [Sven Co-op](https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop/), so I thought about naming it `Sdeh Co-Op`, since `sdeh` is one of my pseudonyms. But nah, doesn't sounds good. And since it's a scoop i'm working with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org), I named Sco-Op.  

So this is going to be a multiplayer shooter game, FPS or TPS, in the style of [Sven Co-op](https://store.steampowered.com/app/225840/Sven_Coop/).

## How to build

```sh
# build
$ cd build
$ make ..

# run

```
